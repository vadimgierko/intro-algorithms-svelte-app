# intro-algorithms-svelte-app
 Learning intro algorithms (searching, sorting, recursion, graph theory) with Khan Academy & build with Svelte for the first time.

## Why I've made this site
 This website was created with two goals in mind:

 - to consolidate the knowledge of introductory computer science algorithms learned in the [Khan Academy course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms),
 - to use Svelte and SvelteKit in practice for the first time to build a real world application/ website (*recently I've built another Sveltekit project using TypeScript - e-commerce site - but the current site was the first project using Svelte*).
